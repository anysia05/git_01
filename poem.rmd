## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

One winter night, at half-past nine,  
      Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,  
I had come home, too late to dine,  
And supper, with cigars and wine,  
      Was waiting in the study.

In numbers' silent dance, we find our truth,  
Statistics weave a tapestry of proof,  
They tell the stories hidden in the data's grace,  
Revealing patterns, in each and every case.  
  
Mean, median, mode, they take their place,  
Measuring the center with unwavering grace,  
Standard deviation, a spread's embrace,  
Quantifying variability in the race.  
  
In histograms' bars, our insights gleam,  
Bell curves whisper secrets in a dream,  
Regression lines predict, like a gleaming beam,  
In this world of numbers, we find our scheme.  
  
So let us not forget, in this numeric sphere,  
Statistics' magic, both far and near,  
For in their calculations, we hold the key,  
To understand the world, to set our minds free.
